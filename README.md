### Description <h3>
A small JavaFX app based on the board game Stock Ticker

### Goal of the Game <h3>
To buy from fluctuating stocks in a game to outlast the other players.

### Built In <h3>
The game was builting using the JavaFX library combining:
* Java
* FXML
* CSS 

To build a small GUI application

### What Went Well <h3>
* Splitting the project into manageable chunks
* Using objects to make the program more modular
* Splitting the GUI into a main, layout and controller file
* Using inversion of control to only act on user input

### What I Can Do Better Next Time <h3>
* Work on writing documentation before hand
* Write out UML diagrams to follow
* Use more than just regular class files
* Move code from event controller to composition class
